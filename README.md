# Hello-Programing-Language
This is the Hello Programming Language - a joke programming language with C-like syntax

Repository instructions:
README.md - repository description
hello_interpreter.exe - ready-made program
hello_interpreter.py - source code Hello Programming language
main.hello - file with source code in a Hello Programming language
standart.json - standard input/output library Hello Programming language

An example of a program written in Hello:
```c
include "standart.json"

start_program
{
  print_to_screen("Hello, World!");
}
return 0;
```

You can write Hello code in any text editor. I recommend it in notepad :)
Save the file with the extension .hello
To run the file and see the result, go to the important directory where the interpreter, the language library and your file itself are located, right-click and go to “Open in terminal”.
